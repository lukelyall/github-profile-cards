# GitHub Profile Cards

A GitHub profile card application that uses [GitHub's API](https://api.github.com/users) to fetch user information and display a user's public repos, followers, and following.
# Usage
This application currently displays my GitHub profile information, but can be easily changed to anyone's details by editing the githubrequest.js file. The first line of the githubrequest.js file can be edited to fit a GitHub username:
```javascript
// setting the GitHub username
const  username  =  '[GitHub username]';
```
Changing the [GitHub username] section to a existing GitHub username will display that profile information with the same style as my profile card.
